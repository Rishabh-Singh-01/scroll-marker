### Scroll Marker

A small chrome extension to mark different scroll points in a webpage.

#### Motivation

To be able to easily bookmark some point in a webpage mainly blogs, books and documentation, making it super easy to come back again even after complete restart of the browser (like coming back in few days)

#### Progress

This is still in dev phase.
